I am a Research Associate at the University of Luxembourg, in the APSIA group headed by Prof. Peter Y.A. Ryan.

My research focuses on the design and analysis of verifiable and coercion-resistant voting protocols. I work on the usability and security trade-off, exploring the understanding of cryptographic protocols by voters in order to improve our designs. On the other hand, my interest goes into the formal verification of voting protocols in the symbolic model, by creating proofs for security properties, such as privacy and verifiability. 

I obtained my PhD in 2020 in the University of Luxembourg, supervised by Prof. Peter Y.A. Ryan. Before, I received my MSc. diploma in Mathematics in 2010, at the University Claude Bernard Lyon 1 (France) and I have professional experience as software developer, software architect and network security engineer for 7 years.
